# DHT-11 Module 
# Introduction
 The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins are needed).

In this example, we can directly connect the pins of DHT11 Module to the pins of Mega 2560 Board, and we use pin 4 to read the signal of DHT11 Module. Connect the pin「+」of DHT11 Module to 5V, the pin「-」 to GND, and the pin OUT to pin 4.
