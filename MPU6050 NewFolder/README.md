# Introduction
The MPU-6050 is a 6-axis(combines 3-axis Gyroscope, 3-axis Accelerometer) motion tracking devices. It also includes a Digital Motion Processorâ„¢ (DMP) capable of processing complex 9-axis MotionFusion algorithms. 

The MPU6050 communicates via I2C protocol, making it compatible Mega 2560 Board. It operates at a voltage of 3.3V but can be used with 5V systems using a logic level converter. The module's key characteristics include sensitivity,  resolution, and power consumption, essential for determining its suitability for various applications.
